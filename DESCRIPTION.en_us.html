<p>Gupter is a condensed serif font inspired by conventional English fonts of the beginning of the 20th century like Times New Roman.</p>
<p>Its large x-height and condensed width make it suitable for composici√≥n where the economy of space is needed. The light stems and the subtle details give it a gentle personality and a nice color balance on the page.</p>
<p>The source files included in the repository are synchronized 
    so they will allow the user to create intermediate instances 
    if required.</p>
